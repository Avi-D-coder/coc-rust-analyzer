This is a fork of the [rust-analyzer VSCode extension](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer) for [Coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

It runs, and thats about it. It is very buggy, but will be fixed by the time rust-analyzer it's self becomes usable.

### Install / Contributing
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Avi-D-coder/coc-rust-analyzer.git
```
Then in (N)Vim:
`CocInstall ./coc-rust-analyzer`
